Disclaimer
----------

Stamp Info is a pre-production tool that has been developed to support the previz of an animated TV series we did at Ubisoft between
January 2020 and February 2021. We believe it can be very interesting for the Blender community so we shared it as an open source project and we keep supporting it.

Since it was dedicated to our production needs some limitations may appear for a more general purpose. Quality of the code is also probably arguable.
In spite of all our efforts to make it reliable, it may in some circumstances corrupt you Blender scenes data.
Be aware that neither Ubisoft nor Ubisoft employees can be taken as responsible in such cases. Use it at your own risks.

**This said, we will do our best to listen to your feedback and improve this add-on accordingly in order to provide a robust and flexible production tool.
Have fun !**
