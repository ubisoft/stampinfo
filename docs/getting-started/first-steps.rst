First steps
===========

If you haven't done it yet, it is time to read the :ref:`Stamp Info General Philosophy <general-philosophy>` 
to clearly understand the purpose of this tool.

   <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 45%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 80%; border:solid 0.1em; border-color:#4d4d4d; align=center; margin: auto;">

Once the add-on is installed open the Stamp Info panel. You will find it among the right tab panels.

The first thing to do, for each new scene, is to define how the stamped information will be written
onto the rendered image. To do so choose between the 2 avalable modes of the :ref:`Final Resolution Mode <final-resolution>`
dropdown list.

Check the information you want to see displayed in the rendered images in the various category rollouts.

Then press one of the Render buttons at the top of the Stamp Info panel. This will compute the final image(s) according
to the render settings of the scene.
